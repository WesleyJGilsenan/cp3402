# Week 8 Learning Journal - Wesley Gilsenan 2024

## Learning Experiment

My learning experiement will be contiuing my test with the Pomodoro technique, which is to work for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break and repeat that.

My thoery is that I will be able to complete more work and stay on track using this technique when compared to just doing work normally.

The way I will test this is with the notes I need to make for Data Mining. First I will do an hour of just working normally and then I will switch over to the Pomodoro technique and see which one I achieve more with.

## Learning Insights

So I spent an hour of just working normally doing my notes for Data Mining and I have to say that I was struggling by the end and my productivity was becoming worse and worse. I became distracted easily and I didn't get as much done as I wanted. 

I will take a break and then test out the Pomodoro technique for an hour.

I have now spent an hour doing my notes using the Pomodoro technique and I found myself to be much more productive and surprisingly willing to get back to work.

Overall I found the pomodoro technique to be the better way for me to work. I will continue using it in the future and record my progress with it.

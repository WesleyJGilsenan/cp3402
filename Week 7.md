Php programing is quite interesting but I will admit that I have struggled a bit with it.
Been a while since I setup a new programing launguage on my computer.
I had forgotten that I needed to install the language itself and then the extensions, I tried only installing the extensions and then wondered why it wouldn't work.
For future me if I ever need to re-install php:
I installed php via xampp and then got vs code to run a local server with the PHP IntelliSense and PHP Intelephense Extensions. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

My time management practice has been going well. Lindsay recommended that I could try the Pomodoro technique and I find that I am able to say on track which small breaks every 25 minutes. I have noticed that I am much more productive and don't look at the work I need to do with annoyance.

I will continue to practice this and report on my findings.

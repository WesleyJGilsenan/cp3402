Going to be honest this week I didnt have many insights.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Two weeks ago I said that I was going to split my work up across multiple days during the week. After running that way for two weeks I think I can say that it works for me and that I will be using it in the future.

However this way of working might not work in the workplace as most projects would set deadlines and thus only working on small pieces might not work out.

I need to find a middle ground for this idea and that is what I will be focusing on for the next week.

## Content Insights

While I didn't have a lot of time this week due to unforseen circumstances, I was confused about the difference between wordpress.org and wordpress.com as Lindsay mentioned it and I wanted to be sure I knew the difference. Now I know that .org is the software used to create the website hub and .com is a host that also has the website hub software also known as a Software as a Service.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I lost quite a bit of my study time this week but I am somewhat happy with what I managed to achieve. What I am going to do next time is split my study time up over each day so that I only have a small amount per day and if something comes up it won't take away from my studies. It also means that I don't feel that I am doing a huge amount of work and won't become demoralised.

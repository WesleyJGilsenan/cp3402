## Content Insights

It was fun to learn about how different websites become compromised and how developers try their best to plug up the most common holes. In the future I plan to continue my stratagy of being safe online and using strong passwords. I also plan to keep my ear close to the ground incase of any security risks to whatever and wherever I am working at so a fix or plan can be put in place to minimise risk.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week it was interesting to see how my group was planning to run the presentation and as it turned out, my experience with events and media presentation helped a lot. First we chose to do it all online via discord and had one person record it and then edit it.

Our first run through was short and we missed quite a few things. I then edited our script to include steps for each person so we wouldnt skip over anything. We then had our second run where if anything was missed we would start that section again and do it better as we didn't want to only do half a job.

I then took the recording and editted it down and uploaded it for my team members to watch and check to make sure it was good. There were three areas in the video that my team pointed out and I fixed those up.

I believe that my preperation from last week was helpful as I felt that I was confident and able to speak clearly and wasn't in a race to finish the presentation as quickly as possible.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week multiple assignments started and now my time management skills are being put to the test. I hope that I will manage my time efficently but we shall see. 

I also have been improving my communication skills with those who I am grouped with by making sure that everything is clear and that if anyone has questions they should ask.

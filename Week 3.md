## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
In the interviews I experienced many different feelings. It started with the feeling of being uncomfortable and not prepared even thought I knew this was going to happen. Then came annoyance with myself which showed in the interviews I did. Finally I had done a few interviews and had "borrowed" questions and ideas. I found some people that I want to have in my group so that is good. 

What I need to do for next time is do better to prepare for activites like this and be better at thinking on the spot and dealing with the unknown. I really struggled with that on Friday.

For my learning insights, I really enjoyed learning about how hosting different content and seeing what has been learned in the past. Being able to see those lessons in the popular websites today (Google Images, Youtube, Github) I found interesting and I will now look on websites with a new understanding but there is more to learn. 

What I want to focus on next is more of these lessons on content hosting and how local environments work.

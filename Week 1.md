# Week 1 Learning Journal - Wesley Gilsenan 2024


## Learning Activates and Resources
This week a way to revise html and css I re-watched a few videos and read up on powerpoints from Year 1 Web Design subject.

## Estimated Hours
I believe I spent about 1 and a half hours on this study.


## Content Insights
Re-introducing myself into html and css via the year 1 web Design subject helped me re-gain my understanding of html and css and if I had questions I genuinely think I will be able to find most in those videos and power points.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I did't have much time this week to do Learning Activites due to me making an assumption that all the work I would need to do was watch the lecture video and do the prac. Now that I know I need to spend some time during the week doing learning activites I will make time for it.

I also realised that I hadn't done anything to keep my html and css skills up and found myself very rusty. This has showed me that I need to keep my skills up if I want to make myself more employable and not just wing it all the time.

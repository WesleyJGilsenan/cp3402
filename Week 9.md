This week I started preping for the rehearsal as I can struggle to speak while under pressure. The ways that I practiced was acting as if I was running one of my DND games as I find that to be less stressful. 

I wrote some notes in the style that I use for my DND. I reminded myself that I need to speak slower and louder. 

This isnt a race and we dont need to finish it as fast as possible.

With this practice I found that I was speaking clearer and I had more confidence.
